# Overview

For this team project, we built a web application for early grade education, specifically targeting the grades between kindergarden to 2nd grade. This app allows for users to be tested in a math section as well as a reading section as well as fill out a contact form and apply for the app newsletter. This application will utilize Python and Django to display the front-end, and will utilize Bootstrap 5 to provide front-end styling. We have designed this app to provide users with questions in the various sections, and they will be given an answer to each question once they press the submit button.

This application was created to showcase our learning/understanding of creating a web application using Django and Python and also showcase our ability to work together as a team to design and create this project within a set time frame.
